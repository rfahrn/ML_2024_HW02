    "To solve this task efficiently, here are some practical suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** to read relevant documentation, e.g. for [python](https://docs.python.org/3/), [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/), [matlpotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Also remember to use tutorials, lecture slides, and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of rewriting existing code try to use **BUILT-IN METHODS** available in the libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* To complete this part of the homework, you have to write some **CODE** directly inside the specified places in the notebook **CELLS**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In some problems you are asked to provide a short discussion of the results. In these cases you have to create a **MARKDOWN** cell with your comments right after the corresponding code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* For every separate problem, you can get **INTERMEDIATE scores**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your **SOLUTION** notebook **MUST BE REPRODUCIBLE**, i.e. if a reviewer executes your code, the output will be the same (with all the corresponding plots) as in your uploaded notebook. For this purpose, we suggest to fix random `seed` or (better) define `random_state=` inside every algorithm that uses some pseudorandomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your code must be readable. For this purpose, try to include **necessary** (and not more) comments inside the code. But remember: **GOOD CODE MUST BE SELF-EXPLANATORY**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many `sklearn` algorithms support multithreading (Ensemble Methods, Cross-Validation, etc.). Check if the particular algorithm has `n_jobs` parameter and set it to `-1` to use all the cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the end you need to hand in a **single zip file** containing **two notebooks** (theory and practice) as well as the **html exported version** of this notebook (**4 files in total**).\n",

    "\n",

We only tried one, but there are more (e.g. TF-IDF Vectorizer is another powerful method to transform text to a vector, taking into account the rareness of the words across the texts). Also do not hesitate to play with the arguments of the *Vectorizers*. \n",

    "3) **Change your model.** You are not restricted to train *Naive Bayes* only. You can use whatever algorithm you're already familiar with. Moreover, you can use the algorithms that you get to know during these 3 weeks of solving this assignment. E.g. give *RandomForests* a try!"
